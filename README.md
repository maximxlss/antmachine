# antmachine
Weird ant-like agents experiment.

White dots are ants. Grey traces are pheromones. Ants leave pheromones as they move. Pheromones attract ants as they move.

Uses only cpu for computations, so it's slow.

#### This is pretty useless. I'm not exacly sure it's working how it should. Not gonna be developed, just an archive
